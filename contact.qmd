The Hu Lab is now publicly recruiting associate researchers/assistant researchers, postdoctoral fellows, research assistants, and accepting visiting students.

Endogenous double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) needs precise regulation to avoid being recognized as viral RNA by the innate immune system, thereby preventing an immune response. The dysregulation of dsRNA can lead to autoimmune diseases and non-infectious inflammation on one hand, and can be utilized for cancer immunotherapy on the other. The lab focuses on how cells prevent immune responses caused by endogenous dsRNA, studying the regulation and immune responses of dsRNA in health and disease. Research directions include:

1.  Developing new experimental methods to discover endogenous dsRNA and its binding proteins;
2.  Systematically identifying regulatory networks mediated by endogenous dsRNA in innate immune responses;
3.  Exploring the role of dsRNA immune responses in autoimmune diseases and cancer treatments.

Dr. Hu Shibin obtained his Ph.D. in Biochemistry and Molecular Biology from the Shanghai Institute of Biochemistry and Cell Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in 2017, and conducted postdoctoral research at the Department of Genetics, Stanford University, from 2018 to 2024. Dr. Hu has long been dedicated to RNA research, with related research achievements published in journals such as Nature Cell Biology, Molecular Cell, Genes and Development, and Nucleic Acids Research.

The lab is committed to fostering a united and harmonious research atmosphere and sincerely invites aspiring young talents to join the team.
